        <p>An Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts
            can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.

        <h5>ACCOUNT TYPES</h5>
        <h6>Ethereum has two account types:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Externally owned Accounts</li>
            <li>Smart Contract / Internal Accounts</li>
        </ol>
        Externally-owned – controlled by anyone with the private keys
        Contract – a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by code. Learn about smart contracts
        Both account types have the ability to:

        Receive, hold and send ETH and tokens
        Interact with deployed smart contracts
